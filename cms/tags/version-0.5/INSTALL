Requirements:
    PHP 4+
    MySQL
    Apache webserver (or another php enabled webserver)
    BBCodeParser (optional)


1.  Untar the source package to document root dir or your webserver
        - cd DOCUMENT_ROOT
        - tar xvfz cms-VERSION.tar.gz
OR
    check out the latest version from subversion
        - svn co http://svn.wishy.org/cms/cms/trunk

----- If your webserver has write access to your new CMS directory you can skip step 2 ------
2.  create an empty config.php file and make it writable by your webserver's user:
        - touch config.php
        - chmod 666 config.php 

3.  Create the cms database and grant a user rights to use it:
        - login to mysql: mysql -u root -p
            create database cms;
            grant all privileges on cms.* to cms_user@localhost identified by 'cms_pass';
            quit

4.  Optionally install the BB Code Parser.  There is a flag in config.php where you can turn this feature on/off.  The install.php file will set this for you.
        - pear install HTML_BBCodeParser

5.  Fix the permissions on the cache and template compilation directories so the web server has access to them.
        - chmod 777 smarty/cms/templates_c
	- chmod 777 smarty/cms/cache
	- chmod 777 uploads

6.  Open up your new CMS site in your webbrowser and you will be guided through a short install.

7.  After install, for security sake, you should set your config.php back to a read-only state.
        - chmod 444 config.php

Admin features including user management, template management, section management, and of course content management can all be accessed at your CMSROOT/admin.
Admin login: admin/admin
