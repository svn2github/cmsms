Introduction:
=============

This tutorial is for module developers, explaining shortly how you 
can register your own TinyMCE plugin inside your modules. 
In version 2.7.0 we added this support for TinyMCE module, that allows 
module creator to make own plugins for this popular WYSIWYG editor.
In this tutorial i will be explaining how this all works and what 
you can gain from this.

Features:
=========

- Possible to register multiple plugins from one module
- Has failsafe names (means you can't accidentaly make doubles with
			other modules)
- Totally controllable from TinyMCE module panel
- Has plugin description possibility
					
HOWTO:
======

Okey now the interesting part. I will take Gallery module as example, 
since it already has working integration to this.

Registering new TinyMCE plugins inside your module works pretty much 
like Search module's SearchResult() and SearchReindex()
You simply include function: RegisterTinyMCEPlugin() somewhere to your
main module class. Creating actual plugin(s) will happend inside this
function.

TinyMCE expects RegisterTinyMCEPlugin() to return array that consists of
array(s).

Example (registering one plugin):
---------------------------------

return array(array('plugin_name',$script,'My imba comment!'));

What happends there is it return's one plugin that has name 'plugin_name', 
actual script that is included to variable $script and comment.

Example 2 (registering two plugins):
------------------------------------

return array(
		array('myplugin',$script,'This plugin is smart!'),
		array('myotherplugin',$script2,'This plugin is stupid!'),
		);

When ever you are returning one or multiple plugins from function, you 
always have to wrap em into array and include them to main array, like 
i have done in this case.

Example 3 (NOT LIKE THIS):
--------------------------

return array('cmsms',$just,'died!');

In this case you will break whole CMS Made Simple, not permanently, but 
it will cause whole TinyMCE crash, so be careful.

Plugin array should always include these things:

1. module name   ( short name, don't include your module name here, 
		   it will be generated automatically )

2. actual script ( it expects fully working javascript that is based
		   on TinyMCE original register functionality )
					
3. comment 	 ( Allows you to give comment about your plugin so
		   everyone who uses has a bit clue what it does )
					
More info about how to creating TinyMCE plugins you can find from: 
http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:API

Example 4 (Gallery module integration):
---------------------------------------

So here is code of Gallery module TinyMCE plugin registration. Showing 
you working module plugin.

CODE:

function RegisterTinyMCEPlugin()
  {
    $gCms = cmsms();
    $config = $this->GetConfig();
    $galleries = $this->_GetGalleries();

    $plugin1 = "
	tinymce.create('tinymce.plugins.picker', {
        createControl: function(n, cm) {
            switch (n) {
                 case 'picker':
                    var c = cm.createMenuButton('picker', {
                        title : '".$this->Lang('tinymce_button_picker')."',
                        image : '".$config["root_url"]."/modules/Gallery/images/icon_TinyMCE.gif',
                        icons : false
                        });

                        c.onRenderMenu.add(function(c, m) {
                ";

    foreach($galleries as $gallery)
      {
        $plugin1 .= "
            m.add({title : '".$gallery['filename']."', onclick : function() {
                tinyMCE.activeEditor.execCommand('mceInsertContent', false, '{Gallery" . ($gallery['filename'] == "Gallery/" ? "}" : " 
				dir=\'" . substr((empty($gallery['filepath']) ? "" : $gallery['filepath'] . "/") . $gallery['filename'], 0, -1) . "\'}")."');
                }});
                m.addSeparator();
                ";
      }

    $plugin1 .= "
                });
              // Return the new menu button instance
              return c;
            }

          return null;
       }
});
                ";

                return array(array('picker',$plugin1,$this->Lang('tinymce_description_picker')));
        }


ABOUT CODE:

Looks messy hu? Yeah i know, but that's how it is. When creating TinyMCE 
plugins inside your module it will look like this. What code above does? 
It add's new button to TinyMCE that allows you to bring all Galleries 
from Gallery module to TinyMCE. It won't render them to whole gallery 
or anything, don't expect that, it adds smarty code that will eventually 
generate actual gallery to your frontend.

WHY?
====

Question is why we made this possible, what this helps, and who?
Well system is supposed to be simple as possible right? Some people 
find it so hard to copy paste code from place A to B, well this makes 
that part easier for your endusers. it makes possible for you to create
plugins that help other people to make their life easier day by day.

LAST WORDS / WARNING:
=====================

When you are creating TinyMCE plugins and adding them into your modules, 
be aware that resposibility of not breaking modules lies on your shoulders.
We made plugin support as safe as possible, and those plugins are defaultly 
turned off when you install module that has this support, so your module won't
instantly break anything.

Releasing untested / not working code is always bad thing, so if you don't 
know how to, learn. If you can't learn don't add this function to your module, 
it will only break things.

DO NOT PUBLISH BROKEN MODULES WITH THIS FUNCTION INSIDE OF THEM!
DO NOT INCLUDE THIS FUNCTION TO YOUR MODULES IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE 
WHAT IT DOES!

Okey that's enought, go now and play with this :)

If you have any question about this, please don't hesitate to join 
#cms @ irc.freenode.net and ask.
