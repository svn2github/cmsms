{* News module entry object reference:
   ------------------------------
   In previous versions of News the 'object' returned in $entry was quite simple, and a <pre>{$entry|@print_r}</pre> would output all of the available data
   This has changed in News 2.12, the object is not quite as 'simple' as it was in previous versions, and that method will no longer work.  Hence, below
   you will find a referennce to the available data.
